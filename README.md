Data mining for life satisfaction in Australia 2020


# Background

Life satisfaction is the subjective experience of one's quality of life. It is a comprehensive psychological indicator of a person's quality of life. The study of residents' life satisfaction is very important for the development of the country and society. The government can make timely adjustments to relevant policies and related construction according to the residents' satisfaction with their lives. In addition, good resident life satisfaction is conducive to building citizens' confidence in the country and the long-term development of the country.

Research on life satisfaction comes from three main fields namely, research on mental health, research on the quality of life and research on gerontology (Righi & Masserini, 2021). This report analyzes the factors influencing residents' life satisfaction and the prediction of life satisfaction by data mining the public opinion survey on the perception of topical social issues conducted by the Centre for Social Research of the Australian National University in August 2020 (Biddle, 2020).

# Problem Introduction

This report will use data mining methods such as association mining, decision tree classification, neural networks, logistic regression, and linear regression to analyze data on life satisfaction and find its related factors to predict life satisfaction by using the data source of ANU Poll 35 (August 2020).

The project primarily employs R and Rattle for model development and evaluation, as well as Excel and Python for data pre-processing.

The goal of this project is to identify the factors that influence residents' life satisfaction and to develop a useful model to classify and forecast resident satisfaction. In addition, by linearizing the satisfaction of the residents, the discrete attributes are continuous and the specific values of satisfaction are predicted by linear regression, which may not be accurate but can get a specific trend of satisfaction instead of a simple classification.

Through the data mining on life satisfaction, a relatively accurate classifier can be constructed, and the project aims to give timely feedback to the government and related organizations to improve the life satisfaction of the country's residents.
